# Matthew Danda's Technical Writing Portfolio

This repository contains samples of my work as a Software Technical Writer. 

I wrote all the content within these samples. All items are shareable and otherwise fully cleared for public consumption.  

To learn more about me and my approach to technical writing, see my YouTube video, [Matt's Primer on Creating Great Software Documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpSyKAqs3Xc).
