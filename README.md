# Matthew Danda's Technical Writing Portfolio

This repository contains samples of my work as a Software Technical Writer. 

I wrote all the content within these samples. Please note that I did NOT perform the page layout and design. 

All items are shareable and otherwise fully cleared for public consumption.

A substantial portion of my work consists of User Guides and Configuration Guides that are, unfortunately, marked as Company Confidential. As a result, they are not represented in this portfolio.
